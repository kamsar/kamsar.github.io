Synthesis 7.2.1 has been released to [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Synthesis).

This release includes:

* a [bug fix](https://github.com/kamsar/Synthesis/issues/7) from [@Gobiner](https://twitter.com/gobiner) for internal links with query strings, 
* a [bug fix](https://github.com/kamsar/Synthesis/issues/11) for content search index issues when the master database has been removed, reported by [@GreyGhostStudio](https://twitter.com/GreyGhostStudio)
* the `Add<T>()` method of Synthesis objects now supports interfaces instead of just concrete types. A suggestion from [@ullmark](https://twitter.com/ullmark)

In addition, Synthesis 7.2.1 has been tested on the Sitecore 8 technical preview and operates without issue.

Have fun!
