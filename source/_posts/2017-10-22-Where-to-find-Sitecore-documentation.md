The land of Sitecore documentation is becoming a bit crowded these days. While at Symposium, I heard some people say they didn't know how to keep up on new documentation - so here's what I know. No doubt I missed some resources too, but these are the ones I usually use and follow.

# Official Docs

## [Sitecore Doc Site](https://doc.sitecore.net)

This is the main place to find documentation for Sitecore, as well as Sitecore modules. It has a handy [RSS feed](https://doc.sitecore.net/~/link.aspx?_id=C12C95F2683A4AF98BABA504B4701DD7&_z=z) of updated articles you should subscribe to.

Unfortunately the RSS feed is not entirely complete due to documentation microsites being proxied in under the main doc site (for example [Commerce](http://commercesdn.sitecore.net/SitecoreCommerce/UsersGuide/en-us/index.html) and the [v9 Scaling Guide](https://doc.sitecore.net/developers/scaling-guide/)). These statically generated sites generally do not provide their own RSS feeds, and are thus harder to track updates to.

## [Sitecore Knowledge Base](https://kb.sitecore.net/)

The Sitecore KB lists known issues, support resolutions, security bulletins, and other support information. Like the main doc site, it has its own [RSS feed](https://kb.sitecore.net/en/Articles_RSS_Feed.aspx) of updated articles that is absolutely worth subscribing to.

## [Sitecore Helix Docs](http://helix.sitecore.net/)

Sitecore's official architecture guidance has its own website. Unfortunately, no RSS feed of updates.

## [Sitecore JSS Docs](https://jss.sitecore.net/)

The JavaScript Services module has its own separate documentation site. Unfortunately, no RSS feed of updates.

## [Sitecore Dev Site](https://dev.sitecore.net/)

Where to go to actually download Sitecore releases and official modules such as SXA and PXM. There's no RSS feed of new releases and updates, unfortunately.

# Community-run Docs

## [Sitecore Blog Feed](http://feeds.sitecore.net/)

A Sitecore-run blog aggregator that serves up a fresh helping of most major Sitecore blogs. Worth subscribing to via its [RSS feed](http://feeds.sitecore.net/Feed/LatestPosts).

## [Sitecore StackExchange](https://sitecore.stackexchange.com/)

A community-driven Q&A site that's part of [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/). If you have a question about Sitecore, there are many highly active members who are happy to help here.

## [Sitecore Slack](https://www.akshaysura.com/2015/10/27/how-to-join-sitecore-slack-community-chat/)

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a group messaging/discussion tool. The Sitecore Community Slack group has over 2,700 Sitecore developers with very active participation. If you do Sitecore, you should be here.

## [Unofficial Sitecore Training](http://www.akshaysura.com/2016/02/03/unofficial-sitecore-8-training-webinar-series-full-curriculum/)

Community run unofficial training videos that cover development practices that are commonly used, but not covered in official Sitecore training. More opinionated, influenced heavily by real-world implementation experiences.

## [Sitecore Community Docs](https://sitecore-community.github.io/docs/)

Unofficial documentation. Not updated that often any longer but still some good information, especially the article on [config patching](http://sitecore-community.github.io/docs/documentation/Sitecore%20Fundamentals/Patch%20Files/).

## [Sitecore Powershell Extensions Docs](https://sitecorepowershell.gitbooks.io/sitecore-powershell-extensions/)

The SPE documentation is so complete that it's worth mentioning even though it's for a single Sitecore module.
