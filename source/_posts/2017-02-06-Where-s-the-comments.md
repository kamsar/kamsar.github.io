Because of low utilization and the fact that Disqus is about to start [spamming you with wonderful ads](http://www.daedtech.com/im-quitting-disqus/), I've decided to turn comments off on my blog. 

That's not to say you're not allowed to comment, because you can [tweet](https://twitter.com/kamsar) your comments or join [Sitecore Community Slack](https://www.akshaysura.com/2015/10/27/how-to-join-sitecore-slack-community-chat/) and comment all day.

In other news the blog is now fully SSL enabled, courtesy of [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

Happy hacking!
